I am interested in the latest trends in the Big Data and Cloud Computing Arena. I would like to see how these can be used to enhance and improve Businesses especially in the developing world - AFRICA in particular. I am also going to be looking at how companies can use  unstructured data from Social Media , Web and other such platforms -  where more than 50 % of these communications are not necessarily in the main Languages (English, French, Portuguese .e.t.c) but in local (vernacular) languages.
